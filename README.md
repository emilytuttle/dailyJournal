# Overview

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C# language.}
I wrote software creating an application to write journal entries about a daily schedule. The software uses two custom classes, each with their own methods. The software runs through the main Program.cs file and contains variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes. This software reads from and writes to a file.

I write this software to provide a place for someone to keep track of their daily schedule. My mom has written what she did daily, just a small blurb, for years. This would be an easier way for her, or someone like her, to have that information saved somewhere other than a tabletop calendar or postit notes.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to build my program. I coded in C#, and used some built in libraries. Thiss allowed me to use the current date.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- In the future, I will try to write to a different type of file. I want to try a json file next.
- I will add the option to save to different files and allow the user to type that file name in.
- I will make the entry hold more information, such as a title that the user can enter.
